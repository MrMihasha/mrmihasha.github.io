Hello! I'm learning cybersecurity, adore to invest in crypto and losing money there 🥴
Taking part in CTF's and working on my future projects.
 
My motto ➡️ Working hard, procrastinating and dreaming. 

I don’t know exactly what I’m gonna come up with, but I’m moving forward and becoming a better 🤔

For you this site is my contacts and maybe some new information about my way.

For me this site is my notes/backup of everything that I learned through the time. 

Here will be my the most significant events and funny stories. But of course the main activity will be in my social networks. For certain events also will be some walkthroughs 🔥

Cheers! 🥂
